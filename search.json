    "section": "Sender MCU Design",
    "text": "Sender MCU Design\nFor the sender MCU, it will utilize TRNG to generate random keys, it will connect to the sender FPGA where encryption occurs, it will be connected to a ESP8266 where user inputs occur, and it will be connected to the receiver FPGA to send over the randomly generated keys and the total number of 128-bit blocks of the message that is being sent by the user. Below, we will describe in detail how this was implemented.\n\nTRNG Implementation\nThe STM32L432KC MCU has a built in True Random Number Generator (TRNG). The TRNG generates 32 random bits, so we need to read it four times to generate 128 random bits, which equates to a random key that is used for AES-128 encryption. The code is designed so that when the sender sends a message over the website UI, the website calculates how many 128 bit blocks are required to send over the message. The MCU code will then generate a random 128 bit key for each of the message blocks and store it on an array in the MCU to be sent to the sender and receiver FPGA.\n\n\nConnection with Sender FPGA\nThe STM32 MCU interacts with the sender FPGA via SPI, which is the same as the way it was set up in lab 7. The data that is sent over to the FPGA is the plaintext and its randomly generated key. Given that our system is built to be able to send multiple 128 bit blocks, we need to know when the FPGA has encrypted a block and is ready to receive the next block and encrypt it. This is achieved by the FPGA sending a done signal to the MCU so that the MCU will send over the next set of plaintext and key. The very first block sending of the program is triggered by the user when hitting the send button on the website, all subsequent block sending is based on the done signal sent by the FPGA.\nIn terms of hardware, in order to save pins, we will be using the same output pins for the SPI connections between the MCU and both the sender and receiver FPGA. In other words, it means that SCK, COPI, and CIPO are the same MCU pins wired to both FPGAs. In order for the two FPGAs to not read the wrong data, we have a separate chip enable wire going to each of the FPGAs. That way, each FPGA knows when the data sent over SPI is meant for it.\n\n\nESP8266 Integration\nThe sender MCU uses an ESP8266 for its messaging UI for both the sender and receiver. THe MCU and ESP8266 connect via USART, which is the same as we have done with previous labs. On the sender side, the user will input their desired message. They can then click the convert button, which will show them how many blocks of data are gonna be sent, as well as the data that will be sent. The data will be in hex, which is the ASCII equivalent of the text in hex form, which is what we need to input into the FPGA. Since the FPGA uses AES-128 encryption, we need to ensure that each block of text is 128 bits long, even if the message is not that long. To do this, we can use padding, which will fill the remainder of the 128 bit block. We used PKCS #7 padding, which will fill in the remainding bytes needed in the block with the number of bytes that it is filling in. 128 bit blocks are equivalent to 16 bytes, so if we only use 8 bytes worth of text in the block, it will fill the remaining 8 bytes with 0x08. Then, the user can click send, which will start the whole sending transaction for the system. Below is a sample image of what the website UI looks like for the user:\n\n\n\nSample Sender Website UI\n\n\n\n\nBackdoor Connection to Receiver FPGA\nSince the MCU is generating random keys for each of the blocks of text, the receiver end FPGA needs to know what the keys are to be able to properly decrypt the message. Thus, we need a way for the receiver FPGA to receive this data. We will use SPI to send each of the keys needed, as well as the total number of blocks that the user is sending. The number of blocks is needed, as the MCU will need to know this information to be able to display a progress bar on our LCD and know how much we expect to receive and make progress calculations.\nAs mentioned previously, this SPI connection shares the same SCK, COPI, and CIPO as with the SPI connection with the sender FPGA. Thus, this FPGA and MCU connection will also have a chip enable, which will tell the FPGA when the MCU is sending data to it."

The data that is sent over to the FPGA is the encrypted cyphertext that it has received via the mechanical actuation system. The FPGA will then decrypt the data and then send it back to the MCU via SPI, which can then be displayed on the website.\n\n\nESP8266 Integration\nThe receiver end ESP8266 displays the decrypted text to the receiver end user, which should match what the sender sent originally. Given that the mechanical system takes a while to send the data, the receiver end website will display one block at a time until all the blocks have arrived to the receiver side and have been decrypted. The receiver end website UI is built to be similar to the sender UI to demonstrate that encryption and decryption worked correctly, showing each individual 128-bit block of data as well as the full message. Below is a sample image of what the receiver end website UI looks like for the user:\n\n\n\nSample Receiver Website UI\n\n\n\n\nConnection with Mechanical Actuation System\nOur mechanical actuation system will be sending data to our receiver MCU via 9 GPIO lines. 8 of them transmit data, and the last one is the clk, so that we can synchronize the incoming data and be able to read it correctly. The receiver end MCU is responsible for reading this data and concatenating each block of data, which will then be sent off to the receiver FPGA for decrytpion.\n\n\nLCD Display Integration\nIn order to track how much data has been sent over and how close we are to the full message transaction being complete, we have implemented the use of an LCD Display. We purchased an LCD Display with an I2C adapter, meaning that it will only require 2 MCU pins instead of 8. This saves up a lot of pins, given that the MCU also needs to connect to the ESP8266, the receiver FPGA, and the mechanical actuation system. To drive the LCD display and the I2C adapter, we need a 5V source, which is provided by our motherboard. For the I2C adapter to register a high value, it needs at least \\(0.7 V_{DD}\\), which is 3.5 V. However, our STM32 pins only output 3.3 V. Thus, we need to use a level shifter, so that the I2C adapter can properly read low and high values. Below is a schematic of our level shifter implementation for our display:\n\n\n\nSchematic for LCD Display with 3.3 V to 5 V Level Shifter\n\n\nTo run the actual display, we were able to use files provided by the manufacturer, which had functions made to control the display. However, this file was in C++, so we had to convert it to C. Once that was done, we were able to initialize I2C on our MCU and display a progress bar on our display. Below is a video demonstrating what the progress tracking would look like:\n\n\nVideo\nLCD Progress Demo"

The key is required by FPGA 2 to decrypt the incoming message, while the length is used for data checking and tracking transfer progress, which will be shown to the user. To support this, FPGA 2 communicates with both MCUs through a custom SPI interface where the FPGA shifts in 128 bits of key and 8 bits of message length from MCU 1 (MSB-first), and later shifts out the same 136-bit block to MCU 2. The protocol follows SPI Mode 0 timing, where data is sampled on the positive edge of SCK during reception and driven on the negative edge during transmission.\nThe design uses two independent SPI masters, MCU 1 for writing and MCU 2 for reading ensuring clean transfer boundaries. Each MCU controls its own SCK and CS lines, allowing them to initiate transfers without interfering or risking accidental shifts and stale data. The signal flow is as follows:\n\nAfter message parsing is done and the key is available, MCU 1 calculates the message length and pulls cs_in LOW to trigger a write transaction on FPGA 2.\nThe FPGA 2 shifts in all 136 bits, then asserts ready, indicating that all data is available.\nMCU 2 receives the signal as a GPIO interrupt and pulls cs_out LOW to begin its read transaction.\nOnce MCU 2 is done, it pulls cs_out HIGH.

    "text": "AES Overview\nAES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a specific key to both encrypt and decrypt data. It is the global standard for secure data encryption and is defined in three key sizes: AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256, where the number indicates the bit length of the cipher key. A larger key size provides stronger security but requires more hardware resources. AES encrypts data through a sequence of sub-algorithms and transformations that repeatedly mix the key with the plaintext to produce a ciphertext that appears random and cannot be reversed without the correct key. These transformations operate on matrices of bytes, with the key itself acting as one of the main transformation matrices. The encryption process consists of four main operations:\n\nSubBytes(): performs a non-linear byte substitution using a 16×16 S-box lookup table.\nshiftRows(): cyclically shifts the rows of the state matrix by varying offsets depending on row.\nmixColumns(): transforms each column of the state matrix using Galois Field arithmetic to further diffuse the data.\nAddRoundKey(): combines the current state with a round key using a bitwise XOR operation.\n\nFinally, these operations are repeated across multiple rounds of encryption, each using a different round key derived through an algorithm known as keyExpansion(). In the AES-128 implementation used in this lab, the encryption involves 10 rounds. Each round follows the sequence: AddRoundKey → SubBytes → ShiftRows → MixColumns, with the final round (10) skipping the MixColumns step."

    "section": "Experiment Setup and Design Overview",
    "text": "Experiment Setup and Design Overview\n\nMCU Setup\nThe MCU was already configured through the provided starter code. It was configured to implement the SPI mode 1. It was also set up as the master with an artificial chip select signal to allow 8-bit CE-based SPI decoding on the logic analyzers. The MCU controlled the internal signals that started the SPI transactions as well as checked results from the transactions. The MCU would set the signal load to the FPGA that prepares it to recieve inputs. The MCU then sends the plaintext and then the cipherkey and then would set load LOW to signal that all data is sent. During that period, the FPGA performs encryption and once all 10 rounds complete, the FPA sets the signal done HIGH so that the MCU prepares to receive the ciphertext. Once received, the MCU compared it to the expected cipher through a difference operation. If all operations yield zero, the green LED through PA9 would light up, otherwise the red LED at P10 lights up indicating that encryption didn’t work properly. This process was always triggered using the MCU reset that restarted the transactions.\n\n\nFPGA Setup\nSince all encryption was done by the FPGA, we had to write SystemVerilog modules to perform the transformation operations necessary for executing the AES encryption. A lot of these operations required heavy resource usage as operations such as key expansion are applied across a 128-bit word. This would always run the risk of exhausting LUTs and other FPGA resources. Therefore I had to take into account how my logic synthesized to ensure the implied hardware isn’t too heavy for the FPGA. The subBytes() lookup table was loaded into the FPGA embedded block RAMs which have the ability to store files upto 128kB. To ensure it is mapped properly to the EBRs, we used a clocked version of the AES byte substitution algorithm named sbox_sync(). This module could only parse an 8-bit word so in subBytes(), it was called 16 times to parse the full 128-bit word. The shiftRows() module performed some row permutation by rotating the 4 rows: row 0 was kept as is, row 1 was shifted left by 1, row 2 by 2, and row 3 by 3. After row permutation, mixColumns() treats each state as a four-byte vector and performs matrix multiplication (Galois field operations) on the bytes in a column withinin \\(GF(2^8)\\) followed by XOR operations to handle overflows. Next up is the addRoundKey() that performs XOR operations between the 128-bit word and the 128-bit key. Finally, I wrote down the module getNextKey() which performed the key expansion part of AES which receives a 128-bit key value and the tound constant, rcon, which is a series of 4-byte words used in the key schedule to create the sub-keys for each encryption round. The module would determine the key for the next round following the implementation and pseudocode provided in the standards document.\nAll the submodules described above were combined in a module named aes_core() whose job was implement the encryption datapath. The datapath followed the structure described in the AES Overview section above. The module took in the load signal that is asserted by the MCU after sending the plaintext and key, then initiated the process. The FPGa would continously reset/update internal signals as long as load was HIGH. For round 0, the plaintext is XORed with the key and the result is passed on to the next rounds. In rounds 1 to 9, the key is updated each round alongside the the input to the datapath. This input is represented in the code as state as it hold the intermediate states of the data in-between rounds. After round 10, the done signal is asserted to prepare the MCU to receive the cyphertext.\nUsing a synchronized sbox meant that it takes multiple cycles per round to process the data sequentially and safely propagate signals through the combinational logic. Therefore I used cycleCountto basically set when to take inputs, when to latch outputs and when to move to the next rounds. The cycle count was also to help account for the single cycle delay caused by subBytes(). Without it, the datapath would race and try to perform key operations before byte substitution stabilizes.\nTo run the setup, we implemented the aes() module that prompts both aes_core() and the aes_spi() module that executes SPI communication betweent both the MCU and the FPGA. Since data is received by the FPGA based on SCK from the FPGA, I added a synchronizer that ensures the load signal referenced by the FPGA for encryption, is latched on the rising edge of the internal clock (HSOSC/clk) instead of the SPI clock domain. This eliminated a synchronization error where encryption would be randomly true/false depending on the data latched. The connection and signals between these modules is shown in Figure 1."

It is meant to house the relay modules in place leaving square openings exposing the 6 screw terminals of the relay module for connectiing other components and terminals. The relay block is shown in Figure 1 below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Isometric View of The Relay Holding Block\n\n\n\nThe tiny circular holes shown at the top hold debugging LED that are used to vizualize if the respective signal line is activated. That is, if the FPGA sends a logic HIGH, the LED in that opening lights up. The other huge opening in the top left holds a toggle flip switch that turns ON or OFF the whole block. The wires are daisy chained to reduce the wiring mess. This is possible because all relays are powered by the same voltage, \\(12V\\), and require the same ground reference. The debugging LED are the hardest to setup. We soldered \\(100\\Omega\\) resistors to the anode legs and bent them to fit into the square openings seen in the block. The other leg of the resistor slots in the signal input terminal of the relay while the LED cathode leg is locked inside the the relay ground terminal. The fully assembled relay block is shown in Figure 2 below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Full Assembly of The Relay Holding Block\n\n\n\n\n\nSoleonid Holder\nThe solenoid block has a square opening to hold the solenoid module. Behind the square holes, there is circular holes that are used create a good clearance for the solenoid spring heads and for them to slide without scraping or locking. The relay block is shown in Figure 3 below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Isometric View of The Solenoid Holding Block\n\n\n\nThe extendedstands from the corners are drilled through to house screws that connect and lock the solenoid block to the relay block. The grounds of the individual solenoids are daisy chained as well and conected to the reference ground of the relays while the power ternimals connect to the Normally Closed (NC) exit terminals of the relay. The fully assembled solenoid block is shown in Figure 4 below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Full Assembly of The Solenoid Holding Block\n\n\n\n\n\nShaft Guide and Shafts\nThe shaft guides block was the most straightforward piece with rings that have a good enough opening to accomodate \\(0.25in\\) thick, \\(5in\\) long shafts.

The fully assembly is shown in Figure 5 below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Full Assembly after Shafts and Shaft Guides\n\n\n\n\n\nLimit Switch Holder\nThe limit switch holder was another crucial part. The kick from the solenoids once energized is huge so the block had to be able to stay stable as well as lock the switches so they press insted of being moved back by the solenoids. The switch holder is shown in Figure 6 below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Isometric View of The Switch Holding Block\n\n\n\nThe limit switches also feature daisy chained ground wires extending out of the back of the block as well as signal lines that go to the MCU. The switches are tightly fit and can be moved back or forward to create the necessary distance ensuring better actuation.
