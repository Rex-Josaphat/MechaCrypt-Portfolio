**Josaphat Ngoga**  
Hi! I’m Josaphat Ngoga, a senior Engineering major at Harvey Mudd College. My interests span both Mechanical and Electrical engineering, with a focus on mechanical design, electronics, and hardware systems. I enjoy working on projects that bring these areas together—especially those involving FPGA development and microcontroller-based applications.
