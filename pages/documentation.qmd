: BOM for Final Project

While we were working on our project, we did not realize how much current our 9 solenoids drew, especially when all of them were on. It was drawing around 0.85 A for each solenoid. The power supply at the digital lab only supplies a maximum of 0.5 A on the 20 V setting, which means we would always overload the power supply. Thus, we were able to use a big power supply that was in the stockroom, which supported up to 12 Amps. Below is a picture of the power supply:
